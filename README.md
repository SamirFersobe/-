# InventorySys
大阪情報コンピュータ専門学校の開発演習授業卒業作品


This is an inventory system application developed with C# on Visual Studio with a Microsoft Access Database. This inventory system is based on a BtB apparel company and as such the database is designed accordingly.
It was developed as a graduation project during my time at OIC(Osaka Information College) in Japan. The development period of this application was from October 2019 to January 2020.
